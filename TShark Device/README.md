# TShark Device
## Introduction
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (GUI) is a network protocol analyzer that is a great tool to discover network traffic, packets and specific information about an ethernet jack (port).<br>
[TShark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html) is a terminal alternative of Wireshark where you can sniff the ethernet jack using terminal.<br>
I am making a device, using a raspberry pi B+ rev2, to scan the ethernet jack and display information (VLAN, IP, Port ID, Switch ID, VOIP) to the e-paper display.
